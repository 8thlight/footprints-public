# Footprints

This program is an applicant tracking tool that allows users to manage the employee hiring process from start to finish.

To run this program, first copy the repository url from github, then run
`git clone [url]` in your terminal to make a local copy of the repo.

This program uses ruby version 2.1.5.
`ruby -v` will display what version of ruby you are running.
	If you are not running the correct ruby version, run
	`rbenv install 2.1.5` to install it using homebrew, then enter
	`rbenv local 2.1.5` to switch to this ruby version.

Next, enter
`bundle install` to install all gems used in this program.
	If you do not have bundler installed, enter
	`brew install bundler` first.

Enter
`rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to populate
the database with default values.

Enter
`rails server` to start the program locally.

Enter
`localhost:3000` as a url in your web browser of choice to view the program.

## Running Footprints using Docker

Using Docker to run Footprints will allow you to avoid the annoying step of
managing multiple versions of Ruby on your host OS, and will hopefully also
make it easier to run on a non-Mac environment.

1. [Install the appropriate version of Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for your host OS

2. Once your local Docker agent is running, [use Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to bring up the Rails environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/footprints-public

docker-compose up
``` 

This step should run the Rails application, **which may fail if you have not run the migrations yet**. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see a web application running.

3. To manage gems, or run Rails, Bundler, or Rake commands, you will want to do that from inside of the running Ruby container:

```bash
cd /path/to/footprints-public

docker-compose exec ruby bash
```

4. To run the migrations, use the instructions from the previous step to open a bash session inside of the running `ruby` container, and then execute the command `bin/rake db:migrate` to run all of the migrations.

5. To bring the application back down, run `docker-compose down`

#### Note

Footprints requires anybody who logs in to also be a crafter. You will have to manually add a person to the system as a crafter in order to log into Footprints.
